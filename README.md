#### What is a Single-Page Web Application?

A single-page application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.

   4. Add changes to README.md if needed
4. Commit changes to your own branch
